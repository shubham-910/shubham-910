## 🔭 About Me
I am driven by a commitment to quality and efficiency:

* **Experienced** in building high-performance web applications and cloud architectures.
* Strong emphasis on **automation, TDD/BDD, and developer experience**.
* I enjoy designing systems that are **easy to deploy, monitor, and scale** in production.

In parallel, I am actively working on **AI/ML, Agentic AI, and multi-agent systems**, focusing on how intelligent agents can automate workflows, enhance decision-making, and integrate seamlessly into production grade software systems.
